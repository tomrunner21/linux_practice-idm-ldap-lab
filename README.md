# linux_practice-idm-ldap-lab
a local FreeIPA (IdM) lab you can spin up on your laptop with VirtualBox/Vagrant, join a couple of Linux clients to the domain, and then automate user/group management with Python. This maps directly to: LDAP/Kerberos/SSSD, token-based auth, config mgmt, and RHEL admin
